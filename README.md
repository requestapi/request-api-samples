## Installing
`npm install`

## Building
`npm run build`


## Running
Make sure you run the build command before using any of these commands.

* `npm run auth` for access tokens
* `npm run contact` for doing contact flow
* `npm run remove-all-contacts` to remove all your contacts
* `npm run request-money` to request money

Note you can change your `.env` file and NOT rerun the `npm run build` command (basically not have to recompile) to be able to use these commands.
